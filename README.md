### **Project Overview: Fraud Detection Using LLM and RAG**

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to identify potential fraud in financial data. It combines cutting-edge AI methodologies to build a robust system for detecting anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior in financial statements. Below is a breakdown of the project:

---

### **1. Core Components**
#### **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
- Used for analyzing financial statements.
- Detects anomalies and fraudulent patterns by understanding textual data.
- Provides natural language insights into potential fraud.

#### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
- Enhances LLM capabilities by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base.
- Ensures that the system uses the most pertinent information for fraud analysis.
- Aids in generating precise, context-aware fraud reports.

### **2. Workflow**
#### **Input:**
- Financial documents such as statements, reports, or filings.

#### **Process:**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Simulated financial data with labeled "fraud" and "non-fraud" statements.
   - Text preprocessing using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to clean and tokenize text.

2. **Vectorization:**
   - Financial statements converted into embeddings using the Hugging Face embeddings model.
   - Stored in a Chroma vector store for efficient retrieval.

3. **Fraud Analysis:**
   - Queries analyzed using the LLM model integrated with the RAG pipeline.
   - Relevant data retrieved from the Chroma store for generating detailed explanations.

#### **Output:**
- A report detailing fraudulent behavior, backed by retrieved evidence and contextual insights.

### **3. Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy.
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK for text cleaning and tokenization.
- **Vector Store:** Chroma for document storage and retrieval.
- **LLM Framework:** Hugging Face for model deployment.
- **GPU Acceleration:** CUDA and BitsandBytes for efficient inference.

---

### **4. Key Features**
- **Realistic Dataset Creation:**
   - 20 predefined fraud patterns and non-fraud statements.
   - Shuffled dataset of 80 records with labels (`fraud_status`).

- **Preprocessing Pipeline:**
   - Removal of non-ASCII characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
   - Tokenization and lowercase normalization.

- **Query System:**
   - The model uses a `text-generation` pipeline for answering queries, such as explaining regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act.

---

### **5. Applications**
- **Forensic Auditing:** Identify anomalies in financial data for investigations.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Assist institutions in meeting reporting standards.
- **Financial Risk Analysis:** Detect red flags in loans, investments, and financial dealings.

---

This combination of **LLM** and **RAG** establishes a powerful framework to identify and analyze fraudulent behavior in financial statements, making it an indispensable tool for auditors, regulators, and financial institutions.
